Which jobs are most crucial?
  - The most crucial job right now is creating the basic functions of the game such as the way towers react with enemies

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
  - At the bare minimum, the core functionalities are the movement of enemies along a path, object interactions and the placement of objects.
  - Non-essential are the map creation, and tower/enemy subclasses subclasses

Which components are prerequisites for others?
  - Before objects can be upgraded, they must be able to be placed in the environment and must be able to recognize other objects.
  - Path finding requires an algorithm to detect a path
  - Specific subclasses of enemies/towers need a superclass
  - Different difficulties require different generated environments and different enemy/tower classes 

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
  - At the moment, the map generation can be delegated because it isn't super important yet
  - Research needs to be tackled collectively in order to plan out aspects of the whole program.
  - Implementations of invidual enemy or tower subclasses can be delegated to group members since they all have similar functions, just different specific values/method implementations
